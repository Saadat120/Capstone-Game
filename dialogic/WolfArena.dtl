Wolf: Ugggh.
Player: Where is your alpha?
Wolf: .......
stag: You were the previous alpha, weren't you?
Birdy: You were defeated and forced to follow an outsider. Our mission is to take him down and return him to his own pack. Won't you help us?
Wolf: ... Fine. I can take you to him, but he is much stronger than I am.
Birdy: We will hunt more of the pack and build up strength.
